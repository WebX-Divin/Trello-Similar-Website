<b> Problem Statement : Create an invitation form for a board in a Trello-like app. Include a reset stylesheet and adhere to the fonts, colors and spacing etc. like in the mockup. You can add styles to input elements just the way we do for buttons.</b>


<b> Create portion of a Trello board that looks like so. Include a reset stylesheet and adhere to the fonts, colors and spacing etc. like in the mockup. You can add styles to input elements just the way we do for buttons. Use flex box layout for arranging the task lists boxes (To do, Doing, Done, and Add another list) next to each other (they will be children of a flex box parent container, say “board”). To get natural height for each task list box, set align-self: flex-start on each of the task list boxes. </b>
